## Advent Of Code 2020

Advent of Code aims to propose each year 25 algorithm enigmas as an advent calendar for developpers.
This project contains my answers to those enigmas, this year in JavaScript.

Each folder contains `solution.js` file, the source code of the solution, and an `input.txt` file, puzzle of the enigma.
